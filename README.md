I am a Junior Software Engineer, who recently completed training at Makers Academy. I've honed my technical skills in full-stack development particularly with Python, Javascript and Typescript with a focus on developing my skills in Object-Oriented Programming, debugging, test-driven development, and web application deployment. With a background in customer success, I transitioned to software engineering driven by a passion for problem-solving user needs directly(instead of being an intermediary).

## Skills

**User Expericence**

User experience has always been a central focus of my work. Whether it was creating an exceptional dining experience or ensuring that customers feel heard and understood. Every customer-facing deliverable presents an opportunity to foster long-term customer relationships, and this principle has been integral to all my work, informing how I have advocated for customers. I have created detailed reports and proactively sought data to inform the product team about priority features/areas. This includes identifying which functionalities an MVP should include and shaping the product's long-term direction based on user feedback and needs. By prioritising user experience, I have contributed to the development of products that not only meet but exceed customer expectations.


**Communication**

All of my roles have relied heavily on the ability to communicate effectively, promptly, and knowledgeably to build trust with both internal and external stakeholders. In my previous position, clear and direct communication was crucial to sharing responsibilities remotely. Managing customer expectations was a key aspect of this role, allowing me to refine various communication skills and quickly assess customer needs. Following agile methodologies at Makers further enhanced my communication abilities, encouraging rapid responses and resolutions to project blockers as and when they arose. 

**Teamwork**

Throughout my career, I have developed a strong ability to adapt to individual communication needs to enhance teamwork. Whenever I collaborate with someone new, I prioritise discussing their preferred work style, communication methods, and feedback preferences. This approach has proven to be highly effective in fostering immediate team cohesion. At CharlieHR, working within a small team and collaborating cross-functionally enabled us to achieve significant results across a wide range of responsibilities. My transition to Makers further refined these skills in a different environment; utilising different techniques engaging in pair programming, collaboratively resolved bugs, and adhering to agile methodologies.
